## The Repository

This repository is where we develop the Erdos code editor together with the community. Not only do we work on code and issues here, we also publish our roadmap, monthly iteration plans, and our endgame plans. This source code is available to everyone under the standard [MIT license](https://github.com/willnickols/erdos/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).

Erdos combines the simplicity of a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. It provides comprehensive code editing, navigation, and understanding support along with lightweight debugging, a rich extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools.

Erdos is updated regularly with new features and bug fixes. You can download it for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Related Projects

Many of the core components and extensions to Erdos live in their own repositories on GitHub. For example, the node debug adapter and the mono debug adapter repositories are separate from each other. For a complete list, please visit the Related Projects page on our wiki.

## Bundled Extensions

Erdos includes a set of built-in extensions located in the [extensions](extensions) folder, including grammars and snippets for many languages. Extensions that provide rich language support (code completion, Go to Definition) for a language have the suffix `language-features`. For example, the `json` extension provides coloring for `JSON` and the `json-language-features` extension provides rich language support for `JSON`.

## Development Container

This repository includes a development container.

* For Dev Containers, use the **Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command which creates a Docker volume for better disk I/O on macOS and Windows.
  * If you already have Erdos and Docker installed, you can get started by cloning the source code into a container volume and spinning up a dev container for use.

* For Codespaces, install the GitHub Codespaces extension in Erdos, and use the **Codespaces: Create New Codespace** command.

Docker / the Codespace should have at least **4 Cores and 6 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)** to run full build. See the [development container README](.devcontainer/README.md) for more information.
